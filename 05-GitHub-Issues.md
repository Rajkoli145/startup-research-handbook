# Chapter 5: GitHub Issues — Mining Developer Pain

> *"An open GitHub issue with 300 thumbs-up reactions and no fix after three years is not a bug report. It's a market research report that nobody charged you for."*

## Why GitHub Issues Are a Distinct Research Channel

Chapters 3 and 4 covered Reddit and Hacker News — both are *discussion* platforms, where people describe pain in prose, often vaguely, sometimes just to vent. GitHub Issues are structurally different, and that difference makes them one of the highest-precision sources in this entire handbook.

A GitHub issue is not a complaint. It is a **feature request or bug report filed against a specific, named piece of software, by someone who is already a user of that software, describing a specific capability gap.** That single fact changes everything about the quality of the signal:

- **The customer is already qualified.** They didn't just think about the category — they installed the tool, adopted it into their workflow, and hit a wall. This is a warmer lead than anything you'll find on Reddit or HN.
- **The gap is already scoped.** Issues describe a specific missing capability, not a vague frustration. You get the Problem Statement Template (Chapter 1) largely pre-filled for you.
- **Reactions are a clean, comparable votes signal.** Unlike Reddit upvotes (which reward entertainment value), GitHub reactions on an issue are almost always literal "I also want this" votes from real users of the tool.
- **Labels do pre-filtering for you.** Maintainers tag issues as `feature-request`, `enhancement`, `wontfix`, `help-wanted` — this lets you filter directly for exactly the category of signal you want.
- **Staleness itself is a signal.** An issue open for 2+ years with continued comments and reactions tells you the maintainer either can't or won't build this — which is your opening.
- **It works for both open-source AND commercial products.** Many commercial SaaS products maintain public GitHub repos for their SDKs, CLIs, or open-source cores, even if the core product is closed-source. Their issue trackers still reveal real product gaps.

The limitation: GitHub Issues skew almost entirely toward developer tools, infrastructure, APIs, and technical products. For non-technical verticals (healthcare operations, restaurant management, legal workflows), you will find far less here — but when a non-technical company's SaaS product does have a public GitHub repo (an SDK, integration library, or open-source component), it's worth checking regardless of industry.

## Anatomy of a GitHub Issue

| Element | What It Tells You |
|---|---|
| Title | The compressed complaint or request — fast-scan layer, same role as a Reddit post title |
| Body | Full context: use case, what they tried, why the gap matters |
| Labels | Maintainer's own categorization — `bug`, `enhancement`, `feature-request`, `wontfix`, `help-wanted`, `good-first-issue` |
| Reactions (👍/👎/❤️/🚀) | Vote count from other users who hit the same gap — the single best quantitative signal on this platform |
| Comment thread | Where people share workarounds, alternative tools, and "+1, also need this" corroboration |
| Linked PRs | Shows whether anyone (community or maintainer) has attempted a fix, and whether it was merged or abandoned |
| Open/closed state | Closed-as-fixed = solved; closed-as-wontfix = permanent gap = opportunity; open and stale = unresolved and possibly abandoned |
| Age | How long the gap has persisted unaddressed |
| Milestone/Project assignment | Whether the maintainer has actually planned to address it, or it's just sitting there |

## GitHub's Native Search Syntax

GitHub's search supports its own qualifiers, distinct from Google's. Use GitHub's native search (github.com/search) for anything requiring label/state filtering — Google Dorks are better for broad discovery across many repos at once.

| Qualifier | What It Does | Example |
|---|---|---|
| `is:issue` | Restrict to issues (not PRs) | `is:issue is:open` |
| `is:open` / `is:closed` | Filter by state | `is:open label:"feature request"` |
| `label:` | Filter by label | `label:enhancement` |
| `repo:` | Search within one repo | `repo:facebook/react` |
| `org:` | Search within one organization's repos | `org:stripe` |
| `sort:reactions-desc` | Sort by reaction count | Finds the most-wanted requests first |
| `comments:>N` | Filter by comment count threshold | `comments:>20` |
| `created:` | Date filter | `created:>2024-01-01` |
| `no:milestone` | Issues not assigned to a milestone | Often indicates neglected requests |
| `in:title` | Restrict keyword match to title | `"export to PDF" in:title` |
| `in:body` | Restrict keyword match to body | `"workaround" in:body` |

### The Core GitHub Search Formula

```
is:issue is:open label:"[LABEL]" "[KEYWORD]" sort:reactions-desc
```

**Example:**
```
is:issue is:open label:"feature request" "bulk export" sort:reactions-desc
```
This finds every open feature request across all of GitHub mentioning "bulk export," ranked by how many users want it most — a ready-made prioritized backlog of unmet needs.

---

## The High-Value Label Taxonomy

Different projects use different label names, but most cluster around these categories. Search for all variants — maintainers are inconsistent.

| Intent | Common Label Variants |
|---|---|
| Feature request | `feature-request`, `feature`, `enhancement`, `type:feature` |
| Confirmed gap, low priority | `wontfix`, `backlog`, `nice-to-have` |
| Actively wanted, unclaimed | `help-wanted`, `up-for-grabs`, `good-first-issue` |
| Bug affecting workflow | `bug`, `type:bug`, `regression` |
| Needs community input | `needs-triage`, `discussion`, `question` |
| Confirmed but stalled | `confirmed`, `accepted`, `no:milestone` |

**Research tip:** `wontfix` is one of the most underrated labels in this handbook. It means the maintainer has explicitly declined to build the requested capability — often for good reasons (out of scope, too complex to maintain, conflicts with their roadmap) — but the underlying need is still real and still unaddressed. A well-reacted `wontfix` issue is a maintainer handing you a validated market gap and telling you, in writing, that they don't plan to compete with you for it.

## The GitHub Issues Query Library

### Feature Request Discovery
```
is:issue is:open label:"feature request" "[TOPIC]" sort:reactions-desc
is:issue is:open label:enhancement "[TOPIC]"
site:github.com "[TOPIC]" "feature request" "would love"
site:github.com "[TOPIC]" "any plans to add"
```

### Wontfix / Declined Gap Mining
```
is:issue is:closed label:wontfix "[TOPIC]" sort:reactions-desc
is:issue label:wontfix "[TOPIC]" comments:>10
site:github.com "[TOPIC]" "closed as wontfix" "still need this"
```

### Workaround Extraction
```
is:issue "[TOPIC]" "workaround" in:body
is:issue "[TOPIC]" "here's how I solved it"
is:issue "[TOPIC]" "in the meantime" "you can"
```

### Stale/Abandoned High-Demand Issues
```
is:issue is:open "[TOPIC]" comments:>30 sort:reactions-desc
is:issue is:open "[TOPIC]" no:milestone created:<2023-01-01
```

### Organization-Wide Sweep (for a specific competitor or tool)
```
org:[COMPETITOR_ORG] is:issue label:"feature request" sort:reactions-desc
org:[COMPETITOR_ORG] is:issue label:wontfix sort:reactions-desc

## Query Library by Developer/Technical Category

GitHub is the right channel specifically for developer-facing and technical-infrastructure pain. Use these seed categories to sweep broadly before narrowing to a specific competitor's repo.

### Developer Tools / DX
```
is:issue is:open "CLI" "[TOPIC]" label:enhancement
is:issue is:open "SDK" "[TOPIC]" "missing"
is:issue is:open "documentation" "[TOPIC]" "unclear"
```

### API / Integration Platforms
```
is:issue is:open "webhook" "[TOPIC]" label:"feature request"
is:issue is:open "rate limit" "[TOPIC]" "workaround"
is:issue is:open "API" "[TOPIC]" "pagination" OR "bulk"
```

### Data / Analytics Tools
```
is:issue is:open "export" "[TOPIC]" label:enhancement
is:issue is:open "dashboard" "[TOPIC]" "custom" "missing"
is:issue is:open "[TOPIC]" "real-time" "not supported"
```

### DevOps / Infrastructure
```
is:issue is:open "CI/CD" "[TOPIC]" "workaround"
is:issue is:open "deployment" "[TOPIC]" label:"feature request"
is:issue is:open "monitoring" "[TOPIC]" "alert" "missing"
```

### AI/ML Tooling
```
is:issue is:open "fine-tuning" "[TOPIC]" label:enhancement

```

### Open-Source SaaS Cores (commercial products with OSS components)
```
org:[COMPANY] is:issue is:open label:"feature request" sort:reactions-desc
org:[COMPANY] is:issue label:wontfix "enterprise" sort:reactions-desc
```

## The Issue Triage Decision Tree

Not every high-reaction issue is a startup opportunity. Run every strong candidate through this decision tree before logging it as validated evidence.

```
Is the issue open or closed?
│
├── OPEN, high reactions, low maintainer engagement
│   → STRONG SIGNAL: maintainer likely won't build this soon.
│     Log as high-priority candidate.
│
├── OPEN, high reactions, maintainer says "planned for next release"
│   → WEAK SIGNAL: about to be solved by the incumbent.
│     Deprioritize unless you can ship faster than they can.
│
├── CLOSED as "wontfix", high reactions
│   → STRONG SIGNAL: explicit, permanent gap. Maintainer has
│     told you directly they won't compete with you here.
│
├── CLOSED as "fixed" or "completed"
│   → NO SIGNAL: already solved. Move on, but note the solution
│     approach for competitive intelligence.
│
├── OPEN, low reactions, but detailed technical body
│   → UNCERTAIN: might be a niche need or an early signal nobody
│     has found yet. Check issue age — if recent, watch it over time.
│
└── OPEN, high comment count but mixed/contradictory requests
    → NEEDS SEGMENTATION: multiple different needs got merged into
      one thread. Read carefully — there may be 2-3 distinct
      opportunities bundled into what looks like one issue.
```

## From Issue to Problem Statement: A Worked Example

Applying Chapter 1's Problem Statement Template directly to a GitHub issue finding:

```
PROBLEM STATEMENT

Who experiences this problem?
   Backend engineers at mid-sized SaaS companies using [Open Source
   Tool X] for internal API monitoring, specifically teams with
   more than 5 services in production.

What are they trying to accomplish?
   Get a consolidated view of API error rates across multiple
   microservices without manually checking each service's
   individual dashboard.

What currently stands in their way?
   [Tool X]'s dashboard only supports single-service views;
   a GitHub issue requesting multi-service aggregation has been
   open for 2 years with 340 reactions and was explicitly labeled
   "wontfix" by maintainers citing architectural constraints.

How do they cope with it today?
   Users report building custom Grafana dashboards that pull from
   [Tool X]'s API individually per service — a workaround mentioned
   in at least 15 issue comments.

What is the cost of this problem?
   Estimated setup time of 1-2 days per team to build the custom
   Grafana workaround, plus ongoing maintenance burden as services
   are added or removed.

What evidence do you have that this is real?
   - GitHub issue open 2 years, 340 reactions, labeled wontfix
   - 15+ comments describing the same custom Grafana workaround
   - 3 comments explicitly stating "we switched to [Competitor Y]
     partly because of this"

What tier is this problem?
   Tier 4 — Operationally Painful (recurring setup/maintenance cost,
   explicit switching behavior observed, maintainer has declined to fix)

What would have to be true for someone to pay to solve this?
   Budget exists (teams already investing engineering time in
   Grafana workarounds); urgency exists (referenced in switching
   decisions); clear ROI (a purpose-built multi-service view
   replaces days of internal engineering work).
```

Notice how much of this template GitHub filled in for you automatically, compared to the Reddit and HN examples in earlier chapters — this is the structural advantage of issue-tracker research.

## A Repeatable GitHub Issues Research Session

```
STEP 1 — Pick ONE candidate topic or a specific competitor/tool
STEP 2 — Run 3 feature-request queries, sorted by reactions
STEP 3 — Run 2 wontfix queries, sorted by reactions
STEP 4 — Run 1 workaround-extraction query
STEP 5 — Apply the Issue Triage Decision Tree to every result with
         20+ reactions or 15+ comments
STEP 6 — For each STRONG SIGNAL issue, draft a full Problem Statement
         (Chapter 1) using the worked example above as a template
STEP 7 — Check linked PRs — has anyone attempted a fix? Was it
         merged, rejected, or abandoned? Log the outcome.
STEP 8 — Log every finding in the GitHub Issues Research Log
STEP 9 — Note every competitor tool mentioned in "why not just use X"
         style comments — carry these into Chapter 6
```

## Common Mistakes When Mining GitHub Issues

### Mistake 1: Only Checking One Repo
The real value of this channel comes from cross-repo sweeps using GitHub's global search (`is:issue is:open "[TOPIC]"` with no `repo:` qualifier). Checking only your one known competitor's repo misses the aggregate pattern across an entire category.

### Mistake 2: Ignoring Closed "Wontfix" Issues
New researchers filter to `is:open` by default and skip closed issues entirely. As covered above, `wontfix` issues are often the strongest signal on the entire platform — don't exclude them.

### Mistake 3: Treating Low Reaction Count as No Signal
Some of the best niche opportunities live in issues with only 5-10 reactions on a smaller, more specialized tool with a smaller total user base. Reaction count is relative to the repo's overall size and popularity — a 10-reaction issue on a niche 2,000-star repo can be proportionally stronger signal than a 50-reaction issue on a 200,000-star repo.

### Mistake 4: Not Reading Linked Pull Requests
If someone submitted a PR attempting to fix the issue and it was rejected, the maintainer's rejection reason is often the single most valuable piece of competitive intelligence in the whole thread — it tells you exactly why the incumbent can't or won't solve this themselves (architecture constraints, scope decisions, maintainer bandwidth).

### Mistake 5: Assuming GitHub Coverage Means Technical-Only Opportunities
While GitHub Issues skew technical, the underlying business problem is often not technical at all — a monitoring dashboard gap (as in the worked example) reflects an operational reporting problem that could be solved as a full standalone product, not just a plugin or open-source contribution.

### Mistake 6: Not Segmenting Bundled Issues
Popular issues often accumulate "+1, and also I need X" comments that describe several distinct, related-but-different needs. Read the full comment thread before concluding you've found one opportunity — you may have found three.
