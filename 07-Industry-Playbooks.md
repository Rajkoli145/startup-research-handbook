# Chapter 7: Industry Playbooks — Vertical-Specific Research Guides

> *"Horizontal research finds problems. Vertical research finds businesses. The difference is knowing which five words to type into a subreddit search that a generic founder would never think to type."*

---

## Why Generic Research Eventually Has to Get Specific

Chapters 2 through 6 gave you channel-based techniques — Google Dorks, Reddit, Hacker News, GitHub Issues, Competitor Research. Each of those works across every industry, but that generality is also their limitation. A generic query like `"[TOPIC]" "so frustrating"` finds pain. It does not tell you the specific vocabulary, regulatory pressure, budget cycle, or buying process of any one industry — and those details are exactly what separates a founder who sounds like an outsider from one who sounds like they've done the work.

An Industry Playbook is the translation layer between the general techniques you've already learned and a specific vertical. It answers five questions that generic research can't:

1. What does this industry actually call the problem? (Vocabulary)
2. Who has the pain, and who has the budget — and are they the same person? (Chapter 1, Failure Mode 3)
3. What tools already exist, and where do they specifically fall short for this industry? (Chapter 6, applied narrowly)
4. What regulatory, seasonal, or budget-cycle factors create urgency or block adoption?
5. Where does this industry actually congregate online, beyond the generic subreddits already covered in Chapter 3?

This chapter gives you the Industry Playbook Template — a repeatable structure for building your own playbook for any vertical — plus fully worked playbooks for twelve industries to use directly or as a model for building your own.

---

## The Industry Playbook Template

Use this structure every time you go deep on a new vertical. It is deliberately more detailed than the Problem Statement Template from Chapter 1 — this is meant to be a standing reference document for an entire industry, not a single problem.

```
INDUSTRY PLAYBOOK: [Industry Name]

1. WORKFLOW MAP
   What does a typical day/week/month look like for the target role?
   List the 5-8 major recurring tasks in sequence.

2. PAIN INVENTORY
   For each task in the workflow map, note:
   - Is this task manual, semi-automated, or automated today?
   - What tool (if any) is used?
   - What's the known complaint pattern? (Ch. 1 pain categories)

3. EXISTING TOOLS LANDSCAPE
   List the 3-5 dominant tools/platforms serving this industry.
   Note pricing model and target customer size for each.

4. BUDGET AND BUYING PROCESS
   Who has budget authority? (Ch. 1, Failure Mode 3 check)
   What's the typical sales cycle length?
   Is spending seasonal or tied to a fiscal/budget cycle?
   Are there procurement or compliance approval steps?

5. REGULATORY AND COMPLIANCE CONTEXT
   What regulations apply to this industry?
   Are there upcoming regulatory changes creating new urgency?
   (Ch. 1, Category 6)

6. WHERE THIS INDUSTRY CONGREGATES ONLINE
   Subreddits, trade associations, conferences, LinkedIn groups,
   Slack/Discord communities, trade publications.

7. INDUSTRY-SPECIFIC VOCABULARY
   List 10-15 terms practitioners use that a generic search
   wouldn't surface (jargon, tool names, role titles, acronyms).

8. SEED QUERY LIBRARY
   5-10 starter Google Dorks combining this vocabulary with the
   complaint/workaround phrases from Chapter 2.

9. MVP HYPOTHESIS
   Given everything above, what is the narrowest possible wedge
   product that addresses the highest-tier pain point found?
```

## Playbook: Healthcare

### 1. Workflow Map (Practice Administrator / Medical Biller)
Patient intake → insurance verification → coding → claim submission → denial management → payment posting → patient billing.

### 2. Pain Inventory
| Task | Current State | Common Tool | Complaint Pattern |
|---|---|---|---|
| Prior authorization | Largely manual | Payer portals, fax | "Takes hours per patient," extreme Tier 4-5 pain |

HIPAA (data handling), CMS billing code updates (annual), state-level telehealth regulations (frequently changing).

### 6. Where They Congregate
r/medicalcoding, r/nursing, r/healthIT, r/PrivatePractice; AAPC (coding association) forums; HIMSS conference community.

### 7. Vocabulary
Prior auth, EOB (explanation of benefits), CPT codes, ICD-10, clearinghouse, superbill, credentialing, payer mix, denial rate, RCM (revenue cycle management).

### 8. Seed Queries
```
subreddit:medicalcoding "prior authorization" "so frustrating"
subreddit:PrivatePractice "denial rate" "spreadsheet"
"RCM" "manual" "workaround" site:reddit.com

|---|---|---|---|
| Contract redlining | Manual, version-heavy | Word + email | "Takes forever," version control nightmare |
| E-discovery | Semi-automated | Relativity, Everlaw (enterprise-priced) | Cost-prohibitive for small firms |
| Time tracking/billing | Manual entry | Clio, spreadsheets | Under-billing due to forgotten entries |

### 3. Existing Tools
Clio, MyCase (SMB practice management); Relativity, Everlaw (enterprise e-discovery) — steep pricing gap between SMB and enterprise tiers is a notable market seam.

### 4. Budget and Buying
Budget authority: managing partner (small firm) or legal ops director (larger firm/in-house). Long sales cycles, heavy reliance on peer referral within the legal community.

### 5. Regulatory Context
State bar data-handling rules, client confidentiality requirements, e-discovery procedural rules (FRCP in the US).

### 6. Where They Congregate
r/paralegal, r/LawFirm, r/Lawyertalk; ABA (American Bar Association) sections; ILTA (legal tech association).

| Month-end close | Semi-manual | QuickBooks, Xero | "Nightmare," multi-day process |
| Multi-entity consolidation | Manual | Spreadsheets | No good tool below enterprise pricing |

### 3. Existing Tools
QuickBooks, Xero (SMB); NetSuite (mid-market/enterprise) — a familiar pricing/feature cliff exists between SMB and mid-market tiers.

### 4. Budget and Buying
Budget authority: owner (very small business) or controller/CFO (larger SMB). Budget cycles often align with fiscal year planning.

### 5. Regulatory Context
GAAP/IFRS reporting standards, sales tax nexus rules (varies by state/country), 1099 filing requirements.

### 6. Where They Congregate

| Subcontractor scheduling | Manual | Text messages, spreadsheets | Constant coordination overhead |
| Change orders | Manual/paper-based | Email, paper forms | Payment delays, disputes |

### 3. Existing Tools
Procore, Buildertrend (mid-market/enterprise); many small contractors use no dedicated software at all — a large underserved segment.

### 4. Budget and Buying
Budget authority: owner-operator for small contractors, project executive for larger firms. Cash-flow-sensitive; adoption often tied to a specific painful project experience.

### 5. Regulatory Context
Local building codes and permitting (highly fragmented by jurisdiction), OSHA safety documentation requirements, lien law deadlines.

### 6. Where They Congregate
r/Contractor, r/Construction; local trade associations (highly regional — national subreddits undercount local dynamics); industry conferences (World of Concrete, etc.).

### 7. Vocabulary
Takeoff, punch list, change order, RFI (request for information), lien waiver, draw schedule, subcontractor.

### 8. Seed Queries
```
subreddit:Contractor "change order" "manual" "nightmare"

### 3. Existing Tools
AgencyAnalytics, Databox (reporting-focused); most agencies still build custom Data Studio/Looker Studio dashboards manually.

### 4. Budget and Buying
Budget authority: agency owner or operations lead. Price-sensitive — agencies operate on thin margins and resist per-client software costs.

### 5. Regulatory Context
Minimal direct regulation; indirect exposure to ad platform policy changes (iOS privacy changes, cookie deprecation) that affect tracking capability.

### 6. Where They Congregate
r/marketing, r/agency, r/PPC, r/SEO; local/regional agency owner Slack and Discord communities (often invite-only).

### 7. Vocabulary
Retainer, scope creep, attribution, client churn, white-label, MQL/SQL, ROAS.

|---|---|---|---|
| Lease renewal tracking | Manual reminders | Spreadsheets | Missed renewals, revenue loss |
| Maintenance requests | Semi-manual | Email, text, spreadsheets | Slow response, poor tenant experience |
| Rent collection | Semi-automated | AppFolio, Buildium (mid-market) | Small landlords use manual/check-based collection |

### 3. Existing Tools
AppFolio, Buildium, Yardi (mid-market/enterprise property management); large gap for landlords managing fewer than ~10 units who find these tools overkill.

### 4. Budget and Buying
Budget authority: property owner (small) or property management company operations lead (larger portfolios).

### 5. Regulatory Context
Local landlord-tenant law (highly jurisdiction-specific), fair housing compliance, security deposit handling regulations.

### 6. Where They Congregate
r/realtors, r/PropertyManagement, r/Landlord; local real estate investor associations (often meetup-based, not online-indexed).

### 7. Vocabulary
Lease renewal, security deposit, tenant screening, NOI (net operating income), cap rate, turnover.

| Inventory/food cost tracking | Manual | Spreadsheets | Waste goes untracked, thin margins get thinner |
| Reservations/waitlist | Semi-automated | OpenTable, Resy (fee-heavy for small operators) | Booking fees eat into thin margins |

### 3. Existing Tools
Toast, Square (POS-centric, mid-market); 7shifts (scheduling-focused); most food-cost tracking still done manually even where POS tools exist.

### 4. Budget and Buying
Budget authority: owner/operator. Extremely price-sensitive — restaurant margins are famously thin (3-5% net typical).

### 5. Regulatory Context
Health department inspection requirements, labor law scheduling regulations ("predictive scheduling" laws in some cities), food safety certification tracking.

### 6. Where They Congregate
r/KitchenConfidential, r/restaurantowners, r/TalesFromYourServer; National Restaurant Association resources.

### 7. Vocabulary

| Quality control checklists | Manual/paper | Paper forms, spreadsheets | No historical trend analysis |
| Equipment maintenance | Reactive | Spreadsheets, paper logs | Unplanned downtime, no predictive tracking |

### 3. Existing Tools
SAP, Epicor (enterprise ERP/MES); many small-to-mid manufacturers run entirely on spreadsheets — a large underserved tier below enterprise ERP pricing/complexity.

### 4. Budget and Buying
Budget authority: plant manager or operations director. Capital-expenditure-conscious; ROI must be demonstrable in reduced downtime or waste.

### 5. Regulatory Context
OSHA safety compliance, ISO quality certification requirements, industry-specific standards (FDA for food/pharma manufacturing).

### 6. Where They Congregate
r/manufacturing, r/6Sigma; SME (Society of Manufacturing Engineers) resources; trade shows (highly influential in this industry, more than online communities).

### 7. Vocabulary
MES (manufacturing execution system), OEE (overall equipment effectiveness), downtime, scrap rate, preventive maintenance, changeover.

### 8. Seed Queries

| Parent communication | Manual, fragmented | Email, apps, paper notes | Inconsistent, easy to miss |
| Attendance tracking | Semi-automated | LMS, paper backup | Reporting compliance burden |

### 3. Existing Tools
Google Classroom, Canvas (LMS); PowerSchool (SIS/administrative) — grading automation remains a persistent gap even within these platforms.

### 4. Budget and Buying
Budget authority: district-level procurement (public schools) or administrator (private schools/higher ed). Public school procurement cycles are slow and tied to annual budgets.

### 5. Regulatory Context
FERPA (student data privacy, US), state-specific curriculum/testing compliance reporting, accessibility requirements (ADA/Section 508).

### 6. Where They Congregate
r/Teachers, r/professors, r/AdmissionsMod; NEA (National Education Association) resources.

### 7. Vocabulary

## Building Your Own Playbook for a New Industry

For any vertical not covered above, walk through the same nine sections. Two practical tips for doing this efficiently:

```
TIP 1 — Start with vocabulary, not queries.
        Spend 30 minutes reading 5-10 threads/articles from the
        target industry before writing a single search query.
        You cannot write a good industry-specific dork until you
        know the industry's own words for its problems.

TIP 2 — Interview one practitioner before finalizing the playbook.
        Even a single 20-minute conversation (Ch. 9, Customer
        Interviews) will surface vocabulary and workflow details
        that no amount of search-based research will find, because
        much of this knowledge lives in practitioners' heads and
        was never written down publicly.
```

## Common Mistakes When Building Industry Playbooks

### Mistake 1: Using Generic Vocabulary in Industry-Specific Searches
Searching "manual process" instead of the industry's actual term (e.g., "prior authorization," "material takeoff," "reconciliation") dramatically undercounts real results. Vocabulary precision is the entire value of this chapter.

### Mistake 2: Skipping the Budget and Buying Process Section
A brilliant product for a role with no budget authority (Chapter 1, Failure Mode 3) is a common trap this section is designed to catch early, before you invest in building anything.

### Mistake 3: Assuming National Communities Represent Local/Regional Industries
Construction, real estate, and restaurants are heavily regionally fragmented. A national subreddit will systematically undercount real activity that happens in local trade associations, regional Facebook groups, and in-person events.

### Mistake 4: Treating the Playbook as a One-Time Document
Regulatory changes, new tool launches, and shifting budget cycles mean an industry playbook should be revisited every few months for any vertical you're seriously pursuing — not written once and filed away.

### Mistake 5: Skipping the MVP Hypothesis Section
Without forcing yourself to write a concrete MVP hypothesis, the playbook remains research for its own sake. Even a rough, likely-wrong first hypothesis gives you something concrete to test in Chapter 9 (Customer Interviews) and Chapter 10 (Validation).
